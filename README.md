![dev-container](./screenshots/dev-container.png)

Open a terminal within VSCode and follow the steps below.

1. Start the minikube cluster
```
minikube start
```
2. Create argocd namespace
```
kubectl create namespace argocd
```
3. Install argocd into the cluster
```
kubectl apply -n argocd -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/argoproj/argo-cd/stable/manifests/install.yaml
```
4. Port forward the argocd UI to port 8080
```
kubectl port-forward svc/argocd-server -n argocd 8080:443
```
The API server can then be accessed using https://localhost:8080.
NOTE: This is a self signed cert, you will need to tell your browser to trust it.
5. Obtain the default password
```
argocd admin initial-password -n argocd
```
6. Login via the argocd CLI
```
argocd login localhost:8080
```
Username: admin
Password: <obtained in step 5>
7. Change the password if you'd like
```
argocd account update-password
``` 
8. Login to the UI!
```
User: admin
Password: <your_password>
```

## Deploy an Application

To get started we will deploy an application via the argocd UI.

1. Open the UI at https://localhost:8080 and login with the username and password you set up before.
2. Click `+ NEW APP`
3. Fill in the following information:
- `General` Section
- Applicaiton Name: `adservice`
- Project Name: select `default`
- Sync Policy: select `Automatic`
- `Source` Section
- Repository URL: `https://github.com/dillon-courts/gcp-microservices-deployment`
- Path: `adservice`
- `Destination` Section
- Cluster URL: Select `https://kubernetes.default.svc`
- Namespace: `default`
4. Click `CREATE` in the top left corner
5. You should see your new app and after a short time it will be marked as Synced and appear healthy.
6. Back in VSCode run `kubectl get all` from your terminal to view the resources generated by the argo app.
7. Go back into the UI and delete the app, we are going to recreate it in the next section.

## Deploy a Microservice Demo

We are going to deploy a microservices demo project that consists of 10 services.

1. Open terminal and run
```
chmod +x create-argo-apps.sh
./create-argo-apps.sh <url of the this repository in your github account> #ex: ./create-argo-apps.sh https://github.com/dillon-courts/argocd-demo
```
2. The script will create an argo application for each of the directories in this project and automatically sync them to your minikube cluster.
3. You can view all the apps in the argo UI.
4. Port forward the frontend
```
kubectl port-forward svc/frontend 8000:80
```
5. View the ecommerce website on http://localhost:8000
