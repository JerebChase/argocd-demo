# Workshop

## Prerequisites
- Visual Studio Code version that can run dev containers
- Docker Desktop

## Install Argo
Open VSCode and then re-open in a dev container.

Open a terminal within VSCode and follow the steps below.

1. Start the minikube cluster
```
minikube start
```
2. Create argocd namespace
```
kubectl create namespace argocd
```
3. Install argocd into the cluster
```
kubectl apply -n argocd -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/argoproj/argo-cd/stable/manifests/install.yaml
```
4. Port forward the argocd UI to port 8080
```
kubectl port-forward svc/argocd-server -n argocd 8080:443
```
The API server can then be accessed using https://localhost:8080.
NOTE: This is a self signed cert, you will need to tell your browser to trust it.
5. Obtain the default password
```
argocd admin initial-password -n argocd
```
6. Login via the argocd CLI
```
argocd login localhost:8080
```
Username: admin
Password: <obtained in step 5>
7. Change the password if you'd like
```
argocd account update-password
``` 
8. Login to the UI!
```
User: admin
Password: <your_password>
```

## Deploy Some Applications

To get started we will deploy an application via the argocd UI.

1. Open the UI at https://localhost:8080 and login with the username and password you set up before.
2. Click `+ NEW APP`
3. Fill in the following information:
- `General` Section
- Applicaiton Name: `adservice`
- Project Name: select `default`
- Sync Policy: select `Automatic`
- `Source` Section
- Repository URL: `https://github.com/dillon-courts/gcp-microservices-deployment`
- Path: `adservice`
- `Destination` Section
- Cluster URL: Select `https://kubernetes.default.svc`
- Namespace: `default`
4. Click `CREATE` in the top left corner
5. You should see your new app and after a short time it will be marked as Synced and appear healthy.
6. Back in VSCode run `kubectl get all` from your terminal to view the resources generated by the argo app.
